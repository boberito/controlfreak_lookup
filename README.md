# Controlfreak lookup

## Overview

The idea is to create a tool that can quickly lookup NIST 800-53 rev4 controls on http://controlfreak.risk-redux.io from the command line.

## Building

The project was built on macOS 10.15.6.

## Usage

Pass the NIST 800-53 rev 4 control you'd like to look up as an argument to the controlfreak_lookup binary.
The installer installs the binary into /usr/local/bin/
